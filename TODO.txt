- should not call setCursor multiple times per command (maybe the cursor position should be the return value and the caller in charge to call setCursor)
- redo bug: avoid unlimited loops
- backwardDeleteWord
- font Awesome
- tables
- mobile support
- colors


Optimizations to do
- deleteBackward: optimize to remove consecutive spaces in one shot
- deleteRange: optimize to remove included full Nodes at once
- idFind is probably very slow
- idSet: assign ouid by reusing parents' ouid
